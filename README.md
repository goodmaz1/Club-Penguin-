# Club-Penguin-
My try at the ML Penguin tutorial. 

Build: 

Sadly, I wasn't able to figure out how to fix the error with Port 5004, so the penguin couldn't move. Looking for answers gave me several options, including turning off my antivirus, entirely re-installing Unity, or just magically having it work after restarting the computer.

At least my fish move around.

For what it's worth, I got through part 3 of this tutorial: https://www.immersivelimit.com/tutorials/reinforcement-learning-penguins-part-3-unity-ml-agents
