My try at the ML Penguin tutorial. 

Build: 

Sadly, I wasn't able to figure out how to fix the error with Port 5004, so the penguin couldn't move.

None of those seemed like it would actually help me, so I managed to find one guy who had updated his code for ML-Agents 1.0. I managed to make his NN work, and so that's what I've posted. 
His github: https://github.com/SP-SuperPoney/ML-Agents-Penguins
My build of his work (once I got it to work): 

At least my fish move around.

For what it's worth, I got through part 3 of this tutorial: https://www.immersivelimit.com/tutorials/reinforcement-learning-penguins-part-3-unity-ml-agents
